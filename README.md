# ILoveNougat
This app searches for item on Zappos.com using their api and then displays in a recycler view. 
If an item is clicked from the search result, it will send a query to 6pm.com and notifies the user if the item is at lesser price at 6pm.com.
It also lets the user share the item details through email.
Big thanks to Udacity which has been big help to learn android app development.
